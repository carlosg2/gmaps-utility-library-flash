Below is a list of the libraries being worked on in this project.


== !MarkerManager ==

This library is a AS3 port of the !MarkerManager in the JS open-source library. It enables developers to easily manage markers per zoom level/viewport, and is commonly combined with clustering. Though Flash is natively better at rendering large amounts of markers, developers have reported increased performance when using the !MarkerManager with thousands of markers.

== KML Parser ==

This library parses a KML file into objects representing the KML dom, and includes helper code for creating a sidebar using the Flex Tree component. Note that this class ignores elements and attributes that can't be rendered in the Maps API for Flash. It's based on the dom classes in [http://code.google.com/p/libkml libkml].

== Planetary Map Types ==

This library contains map types for Mars, Sky, and Moon, and is a port of all the non-earth map types available in the JS API.

== !DragZoomControl ==

This library is an AS3 version of the !DragZoomControl from the JS open-source library. It creates a custom control that lets user drag a rectangle to zoom to a bounds on the map.
