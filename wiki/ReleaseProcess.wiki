#summary Describes steps to take when changing or adding a library.

= Release Process =

After making changes to a library or adding a new library:
  * Re-generate the documentation (See AsDocGeneration). Check that nothing needs to be privatized and that everything public is documented correctly.
  * Commit: new docs, example, source code. Make sure that the mime-types are set correctly for the docs and example (See SVNQuickTips).
  * Update Libraries wiki if you've added a new library.
  * Add any new demos to Flash API demo gallery (Ask Pamela to do this).
  * Post in the forum about the updates.
  * Possibly do a blog post announcing the updates. See BlogPostGuidelines.
