#summary Describes steps to take when changing or adding a library.

= Release Process =

After making changes to a library or adding a new library:
  * Re-generate the documentation. Check that nothing needs to be privatized and that everything public is documented correctly.
  * Re-generate the SWC (change build path in Flex Builder if needed).
  * Commit: new docs, example, SWC, source code.
  * Upload the latest SWC to downloads. Mark it as featured, mark previous as deprecated.
  * Update Libraries wiki if needed.
  * Add any new demos to Flash API demo gallery.
  * Post in the forum about the updates.
  * Possibly do a blog post announcing the updates.
