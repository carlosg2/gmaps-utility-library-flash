In addition to providing an efficient way to zoom in to a specific area on the map, RubberBandCtrl also offers convenient keyboard shortcuts (with support for left and right-handed users) to rewind to previous map views, zoom out, as well as pan in any of four directions.

To zoom in to a specific area on the map, a user would normally click the map and drag it to its desired center point, and then move the mouse to the upper-left corner of the map to select the appropriate zoom level (a few tries might be necessary to get the right fit). RubberBandCtrl provides a more direct way to perform this task, as described below:

Hold a Shift key (the cursor changes to a cross).
Click and hold the left mouse button to anchor the rubber band to the map.
Drag the mouse to stretch the rubber band.
Release the mouse button to snap the map to the area enclosed by the rubber band, or release the Shift key to cancel.
